# StateAffordability
Q&amp;D analysis of the realtive affordability of US states.

This began with my response to a comment in the New York Times:

The oroginal poster observed that California is the fifth largest
economy in the world.  It immediately struck me that a factoid like
that had little to do with affordability.  My thesis is that affordability
is the quotient of income over cost of living.  So I skimmed some data
and mucked around in Excel to calculate the "affordability index" of
each US state.  Nothing really surprising: Wyoming and North Dakota are very
affordable, California and Hawaii not so much.
